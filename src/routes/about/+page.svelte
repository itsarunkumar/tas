		<p>
			At Talks, we believe that meaningful conversations should be open to everyone, without
			barriers or constraints. In a world where digital platforms often demand personal information
			and user accounts, we envisioned something different â€“ a space where readers and writers could
			connect, express themselves, and share ideas freely, without the need for accounts or
			registrations.

			<p class="text-lg">
				Our vision is simple: to create an inclusive digital community where people from all walks
				of life can come together, engage in conversations, and unleash their creativity without
				compromising their privacy. We strive to be the platform where your words matter more than
				your personal data.
